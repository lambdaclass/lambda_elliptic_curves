This folder contains examples designed to learn how to use the different tools in lambdaworks, such as finite field arithmetics, elliptic curves, provers, and adapters.

## Examples

## Basic use of Finite Fields

This library works with [finite fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field). A `Field` is an abstract definition. It knows the modulus and defines how the operations are performed.

We usually create a new `Field` by instantiating an optimized backend. For example, this is the definition of the Pallas field:

```rust
// 4 is the number of 64-bit limbs needed to represent the field
type PallasMontgomeryBackendPrimeField<T> = MontgomeryBackendPrimeField<T, 4>;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct MontgomeryConfigPallas255PrimeField;
impl IsModulus<U256> for MontgomeryConfigPallas255PrimeField {
    const MODULUS: U256 = U256::from_hex_unchecked(
        "40000000000000000000000000000000224698fc094cf91b992d30ed00000001",
    );
}

pub type Pallas255PrimeField =
    PallasMontgomeryBackendPrimeField<MontgomeryConfigPallas255PrimeField>;
```

Internally, it resolves all the constants needed and creates all the required operations for the field.

Suppose we want to create a `FieldElement`. This is as easy as instantiating the `FieldElement` over a `Field` and calling a `from_hex` function.

For example:

```rust
 let an_element = FieldElement::<Stark252PrimeField>::from_hex_unchecked("030e480bed5fe53fa909cc0f8c4d99b8f9f2c016be4c41e13a4848797979c662")
```

Notice we can alias the `FieldElement` to something like

```rust
type FE = FieldElement::<Stark252PrimeField>;
```

Once we have a field, we can make all the operations. We usually suggest working with references, but copies work too.

```rust
let field_a = FE::from_hex("3").unwrap();
let field_b = FE::from_hex("7").unwrap();

// We can use pointers to avoid copying the values internally
let operation_result = &field_a * &field_b

// But all the combinations of pointers and values works
let operation_result = field_a * field_b
```

Sometimes, optimized operations are preferred. For example,

```rust
// We can make a square multiplying two numbers
let squared = field_a * field_a;
// Using exponentiation
let squared = 
field_a.pow(FE::from_hex("2").unwrap())
// Or using an optimized function
let squared = field_a.square()
```

ome useful instantiation methods are also provided for common constants and whenever const functions can be called. This is when creating functions that do not rely on the `IsField` trait since Rust does not support const functions in traits yet,

```rust
// Defined for all field elements
// Efficient, but nonconst for the compiler
let zero = FE::zero() 
let one = FE::one()

// Const alternatives of the functions are provided, 
// But the backend needs to be known at compile time. 
// This requires adding a where clause to the function

let zero = F::ZERO
let one = F::ONE
let const_intstantiated = FE::from_hex_unchecked("A1B2C3");
```

You will notice traits are followed by an `Is`, so instead of accepting something of the form `IsField`, you can use `IsPrimeField` and access more functions. The most relevant is `.representative()`. This function returns a canonical representation of the element as a number, not a field.

## Basic use of Elliptic curves

lambdaworks supports different elliptic curves. Currently, we support the following elliptic curve types:
- Short Weiestrass: points $(x, y)$ satisfy the equation $y^2 = x^3 + a x + b$. The curve parameters are $a$ and $b$. All elliptic curves can be cast in this form.
- Edwards: points $(x, y)$ satisfy the equation $a x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d x^2 y^2$. The curve parameters are $a$ and $d$.
- Montgomery: points $(x, y)$ satisfy the equation $b y^2 = x^3 + a x^2 + x$. The curve parameters are $b$ and $a$.

To create an elliptic curve in Short Weiestrass form, we have to implement the traits `IsEllipticCurve` and `IsShortWeierstrass`. Below we show how the Pallas curve is defined:
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct PallasCurve;

impl IsEllipticCurve for PallasCurve {
    type BaseField = Pallas255PrimeField;
    type PointRepresentation = ShortWeierstrassProjectivePoint<Self>;

    fn generator() -> Self::PointRepresentation {
        Self::PointRepresentation::new([
            -FieldElement::<Self::BaseField>::one(),
            FieldElement::<Self::BaseField>::from(2),
            FieldElement::one(),
        ])
    }
}

impl IsShortWeierstrass for PallasCurve {
    fn a() -> FieldElement<Self::BaseField> {
        FieldElement::from(0)
    }

    fn b() -> FieldElement<Self::BaseField> {
        FieldElement::from(5)
    }
}
```

All curve models have their `defining_equation` method, which allows us to check whether a given $(x,y)$ belongs to the elliptic curve. The `BaseField` is where the coordinates $x,y$ of the curve live. `generator()` provides a point $P$ in the elliptic curve such that, by repeatedly adding $P$ to itself, we can obtain all the points in the elliptic curve group.

The `generator()` returns a vector with three components $(x,y,z)$, instead of the two $(x,y)$. lambdaworks represents points in projective coordinates, where operations like scalar multiplication are much faster. We can generate points by providing $(x,y)$
```rust
let x = FE::from_hex_unchecked(
            "bd1e740e6b1615ae4c508148ca0c53dbd43f7b2e206195ab638d7f45d51d6b5",
        );
let y = FE::from_hex_unchecked(
            "13aacd107ca10b7f8aab570da1183b91d7d86dd723eaa2306b0ef9c5355b91d8",
        );
PallasCurve::create_point_from_affine(x, y).unwrap()
```
If you provide an invalid point, there will be an error. You can obtain the point at infinity (which is the neutral element for the curve operation) by doing
```rust
let point_at_infinity = PallasCurve::neutral_element()
```
Once we have points, we can do operations between points. We have the methods `operate_with_self` and `operate_with_other`. For example,
```rust
let g = PallasCurve::generator();
let g2 = g.operate_with_self(2_u16);
let g3 = g.operate_with_other(&g2);
```
`operate_with_self` takes as argument anything that implements the `IsUnsignedInteger` trait. This operator represents scalar multiplication. `operate_with_other` takes as argument another point in the elliptic curve. When we operate this way, the $z$ coordinate in the result may be different from $1$. We can transform it back to affine form by using `to_affine`.
