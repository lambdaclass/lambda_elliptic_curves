# lambdaworks examples

This folder contains examples designed to learn how to use the different tools in lambdaworks, such as finite field arithmetics, elliptic curves, provers, and adapters.

Below is a list of all lambdaworks examples in the folder:
- Merkle tree CLI: generate inclusion proofs for an element inside a Merkle tree and verify them using a CLI
- Proving Miden using lambdaworks STARK Platinum prover: Executes a Miden vm Fibonacci program, gets the execution trace and generates a proof (and verifies it) using STARK Platinum.
