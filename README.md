# LambdaWorks

The library for kids who wanna learn how to do STARKs, SNARKs and learn other cryptographic stuff too.

> From the heights of these towers of fields, forty centuries of mathematics look down on us. 

This library provides efficient implementation of cryptographic primitives used to build proving systems. Along with it, many backends for proving systems are shipped, and compatibility with different frontends is supported.

Additionally, provers are compatible with the following frontends and VMs:

| Backend | Frontend | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Groth16 | Arkworks | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Groth16 | Gnark    | :x: |
| Groth16 | Circom   | üèóÔ∏è  |
| Plonk   | Gnark    | üèóÔ∏è  |
| Plonk   | Noir    | :x: |
| Stark   | Winterfell | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| Stark   | Miden | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Stark   | Cairo | :heavy_check_mark: |

This can be used in a multi prover setting for extra security, or as a standalone to be used with Rust.

## Citing Lambdaworks

If you use ```Lambdaworks``` libraries in your research projects, please cite them using the following template:

``` bibtex

}
```

## Why we built Lambdaworks

Zero-Knowledge and Validity Proofs have gained a lot of attention over the last few years. We strongly believe in this potential and that is why we decided to start working in this challenging ecosystem, where math, cryptography and distributed systems meet. The main barrier in the beginning was not the cryptography or math but the lack of good libraries which are performant and developer friendly. There are some exceptions, though, like gnark or halo2. Some have nice APIs and are easy to work with, but they are not written in Rust, and some are written in Rust but have poor programming and engineering practices. Most of them don't have support for CUDA, Metal and WebGPU or distributed FFT calculation using schedulers like Dask.

So, we decided to build our library, focusing on performance, with clear documentation and developer-focused. Our core team is a group of passionate people from different backgrounds and different strengths; we think that the whole is greater than just the addition of the parts. We don't want to be a compilation of every research result in the ZK space. We want this to be a library that can be used in production, not just in academic research. We want to offer developers the main building blocks and proof systems so that they can build their applications on top of this library.

## Additional tooling usage

### Fuzzers

Fuzzers are divided between the ones that use only the CPU, the ones that use Metal, and the ones that use CUDA.

CPU Fuzzers can be run with the command ```bash make run-fuzzer FUZZER=fuzzer_name```

For example:

```bash
make run-fuzzer FUZZER=field_from_hex
```

The list of fuzzers can be found in `fuzz/no_gpu_fuzz`

Fuzzers for FTT in Metal and Cuda can be run with `make run-metal-fuzzer` and `make run-cuda-fuzzer`


Run a specific fuzzer from the ones contained in **fuzz/fuzz_targets/** folder with`cargo`, for example to run the one for the target `field_from_hex`:

```bash
make run-fuzzer FUZZER=field_from_hex
```

### Documentation building

To serve the documentation locally, first install both [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) and the [Katex preprocessor](https://github.com/lzanini/mdbook-katex#getting-started) to render LaTeX, then run

``` shell
make docs
```

## üìä Benchmarks

Benchmark results are hosted [here](https://lambdaclass.github.io/lambdaworks/bench).

These are the results of execution of the benchmarks for finite field arithmetic using the STARK field prime (p = 3618502788666131213697322783095070105623107215331596699973092056135872020481). 

Differences of 3% are common for some measurements, so small differences are not statistically relevant.

| `invert` |  10k   | 34.2 ms  | 35.74 ms |

*assembly feature was enabled manually for that bench, and is not activated by default when running criterion

To run them locally, you will need `cargo-criterion` and `cargo-flamegraph`. Install it with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-criterion
```

Run the complete benchmark suite with:

```bash
make benchmarks
```

Run a specific benchmark suite with `cargo`, for example to run the one for `field`:

```bash
make benchmark BENCH=field
```

You can check the generated HTML report in `target/criterion/reports/index.html`
